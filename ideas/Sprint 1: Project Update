### I have completed my MVP (yes/no):
Yes (I think so)
### I have completed these features for my MVP:
Please go to proposal.md for more details!
### For the first half of Sprint 2, I plan to work on:
- Some CSS by using Bootstrap? 
- Optimize the userflow
    - signup(login) -> homepage(get started) -> map -> view pokemons -> detail(change nickname/make comments) -> battle 
- Optimize the battle page (although it works, it can be better)
    - Here are some feature I noticed that not working that well 
    1. click attacker and css not working immeditelty
    2. once attacker and defender decided, then attack button shows up
    3. once battle is down, think about what page or info should be shown (no idea now...)
    4. when Opp/com is attacking, maybe add some css to show that... better for the user to follow
- Capture pokemon with curve throw (like Pokemon Go does)
    - maybe need some js to follow the location of DOM?(not sure yet)
- Player should defeat the pokemon before capture it(not sure yet)
- Level up mechanism (not sure yet)
- Evolution (not sure yet)
### My general work plan/estimate for Sprint 2 is:
- 2 days for battle page
- 1 day for capture pokemon with curve throw
- 2 day for player should defeat the pokemon before capture it
- 2 day for level up mechanism
- 2 day for evolution
